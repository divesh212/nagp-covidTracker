    <h3 style="padding-left: 10px;">Following are some of the precautions as advised by the World Health Organisation -
    </h3>
    <br>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash
            them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills
            viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When
            someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may
            contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the
            person has the disease.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are
            more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain
            physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up
            viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus
            can enter your body and infect you.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild
            fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to
            avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other
            viruses.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but
            call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why?
            National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area.
            Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.
            This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your
            local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what
            people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">To protect yourself and others against COVID-19, clean your hands frequently and
            thoroughly. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash your hands with soap and water. If you use an
            alcohol-based hand sanitizer, make sure you use and store it carefully.</li>
    </ul>
